1. ABOUT

This kit encapsules my personal understanding of a warrior dedicated in upholding  good and right. I always believed that the kensai is the perfect type of fighter and indeed there are legends inspired by kensais able to cut through solid steel cannons and of course we all have heard stories about Miyamoto Musashi...
A warrior able to perform such feats must be strong in both body and spirit, able to withstand physical as well as elemental and  magical attacks. On the other hand his/her devotion to the Light must provide for some exceptional abilities in the battle against Evil. Taking all these in consideration I have created the Morituri kit, the incarnation of the warrior who fights almost empty handed based not on powerfull armour or  magic potions but on unfolding his/her inner qualities through combat experience. It is true a Morituri fights like there is no tomorrow constantly flirting with the possibility of Death but keep him/her alive long enough and your rewards will be great indeed.  



2. INSTALLATION 
                 
This kit runs on BGII. It is recommended that you have ToB installed to enjoy the full benefits.
This kit should be compatible with all current WeiDU mods.

    e.g. "C:\Games\Baldurs Gate II"

2 - Run "Setup-morituri.exe".

You can uninstall any component(s) later by re-running "Setup-morituri.exe".



3. MORITURI KIT DESCRIPTION

One of the most unique melee warrior classes Morituri are fighters who have abandoned the need to use armour or any magic item in order to enhance their capabilities. Their hard and longlasting training has given them the ability to combine the specific skills and feats of the lethal Kensai, the enduring Barbarian,the battlerager Berserker and the lighting fast Monk. Morituri fight toe to toe with their enemies never retreat always seeking victory or death.Although they lack the support of an armour or any magic item at all, their superhuman physical abilities, the perfect control of their Ki energy plus their unstopable determination makes them formidable adverseries and worthy upholders of right and justice in the entire Faerun.Morituri who manage to survive long enough to reach their full potential bear the honouring title of the LightBringer,having become a true force of Right and Justice.Presently only humans are being accepted as candidates in the Order of the Morituri.

4. RECENT CHANGES
                       
Version 1
	* Initial   release.

Version 2
	* Fixed Elemental Resistance
	* Minor spell typos corrections.
	
Version 3
	* More realistic  Morituri Proficiencies. 
                     The use of available weapons is expanded to cover everything except missile weapons and bows.
                     Way of the Sword introduced.
                     The reasoning behind this is simple: although Morituri's train themselves  exclusivelly with swords they are primaly mellee warriors. So in the rare occasion that a Morituri looses or breaks his/her sword she/he should be able to pick up any available mellee weapon and continue the battle, suffering though the penalties applied in such an unfortunate circumstance. 

	*Armour of Light fatigue part  decreases  THACO,Armour Class by 4 points each  instead of 2 points in the  initial release, movement rate by 8  and attack speed by 4 points. Armour of Light itself increases  movement rate by 4 points, ,reduces attack speed by 2,deals  maximum damage for the first 6 seconds instead of 10 in the initial release and gives total immunity to any form of death magic. Many of  the kit's users asked for a tune down of this ability so I really didn't have any other choise but to comply!

C*The extraordinary(by many  users)  immunities on level drain,maze and imprisonment have being removed. With 5 Armour of Lights in the Morituri level you should be able to face any level drain,maze or imprisonment threat.(TIP: to increase your immunity on the previous nasty moments use your AoL additionally, thus when you have reached the fatigue state or some moments before,  use again the ability to have 60 more seconds of the immunities provided and  decrease the fatigue's state penalties at the same time!). 

                   * A more interactive PC: at levels 1,7,14,21,28,35 where the Morituri takes his/her combat titles all the bonuses appear above his/her head.
                      Also ,for TOB holders only, every time that the Morituri uses his/her innate abilities Armour of Light and Heaven's Touch small phrases emerge above his/her head expressing  his/her thoughts for the occasion.       
                  
                    *Remove the globe effect in the AoL ability ala Cloak of Mirroring. The light effect is more intense now!
                    
                    *Upgraded to WeiDU 149, thank's Wes!  

Version 3.x (By Deratiseur)
                   * Trayfied for translations.
                   * Added French translation.
                   * Added sub-component, can now be installed as a warrior or as a paladin.

Version 4 (By Deratiseur)
                   * Compatibility with the EE games added.
                   * French translation lightly revised.
                   
Version 5 (By Deratiseur)
                   * Simplified text.
                   * add "immune to hold" at lvl 28 in the text. The hability was present but not writed.
                   * now ready for lvl 50.
                   * add another option to install as warrior AND as paladin.
                   * The paladin version now have correct "Detect evil" and "Protection from evil" 1x / lvl
                   * Fix the first "bonus to STR, DEX and CON": it wasn't cumulative. (the second from lvl 35 is cumulative)
                   * the scrip no longer use Dplayer2 or 3: it now use the character script. (less use of the engine, less lags on mega installs)



5. FUTURE  CHANGES  

* Fallen Status: In the case of alignment change to Neutral or Evil the Morituri becomes a simple fighter until he/she regains his/her previous status.

* Addition of the Disarm and Knockdown feats as in 3th  Edition  of DaD rules.

* Inner Sight: a special ability that will enable the Morituri to know his/her enemies stats: Level/Class/Armour Class/Hit points/THACO/Number of Attacks/Immunities.
