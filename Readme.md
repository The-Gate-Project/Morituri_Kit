Playable fighter/paladin kit for Baldur's Gate II:
Baldur's Gate, BG : EE, Baldur's Gate II, BG2: EE, Icewind Dale: EE, Baldur's Gate Trilogy (BGT) and the Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET).


## Description:
------------

This kit encapsules my personal understanding of a warrior dedicated in upholding  good and right. I always believed that the kensai is the perfect type of fighter and indeed there are legends inspired by kensais able to cut through solid steel cannons and of course we all have heard stories about Miyamoto Musashi...
A warrior able to perform such feats must be strong in both body and spirit, able to withstand physical as well as elemental and  magical attacks. On the other hand his/her devotion to the Light must provide for some exceptional abilities in the battle against Evil. Taking all these in consideration I have created the Morituri kit, the incarnation of the warrior who fights almost empty handed based not on powerfull armour or  magic potions but on unfolding his/her inner qualities through combat experience. It is true a Morituri fights like there is no tomorrow constantly flirting with the possibility of Death but keep him/her alive long enough and your rewards will be great indeed.  


## Install:

## Version History:
----------------


                       
Version 1
 - Initial release.  

Version 2
 - Fixed Elemental Resistance.  
 - Minor spell typos corrections.  
	
Version 3
 - More realistic :   
 
	- Morituri Proficiencies.
The use of available weapons is expanded to cover everything except missile weapons and bows.   

	 - Way of the Sword introduced.
	 
The reasoning behind this is simple: although Morituri's train themselves  exclusivelly with swords they are primaly mellee warriors. So in the rare occasion that a Morituri looses or breaks his/her sword she/he should be able to pick up any available mellee weapon and continue the battle, suffering though the penalties applied in such an unfortunate circumstance.   

 - Armour of Light fatigue part  decreases  THACO,Armour Class by 4 points each  instead of 2 points in the  initial release, movement rate by 8  and attack speed by 4 points. Armour of Light itself increases  movement rate by 4 points, ,reduces attack speed by 2,deals  maximum damage for the first 6 seconds instead of 10 in the initial release and gives total immunity to any form of death magic. Many of  the kit's users asked for a tune down of this ability so I really didn't have any other choise but to comply!  

 - The extraordinary(by many  users)  immunities on level drain,maze and imprisonment have being removed. With 5 Armour of Lights in the Morituri level you should be able to face any level drain,maze or imprisonment threat.(TIP: to increase your immunity on the previous nasty moments use your AoL additionally, thus when you have reached the fatigue state or some moments before,  use again the ability to have 60 more seconds of the immunities provided and  decrease the fatigue's state penalties at the same time!).  

 - A more interactive PC: at levels 1,7,14,21,28,35 where the Morituri takes his/her combat titles all the bonuses appear above his/her head.
Also ,for TOB holders only, every time that the Morituri uses his/her innate abilities Armour of Light and Heaven's Touch small phrases emerge above his/her head expressing  his/her thoughts for the occasion.       
                  
 - Remove the globe effect in the AoL ability ala Cloak of Mirroring. The light effect is more intense now!
